# Trello Clone Built With Elixir & Phoenix

Based on the amazing tutorial of @bigardone [Link to Tutorial](https://blog.diacode.com/trello-clone-with-phoenix-and-react-pt-1)

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
